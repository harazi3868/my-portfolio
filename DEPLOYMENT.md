# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Guide

This guide will walk you through deploying your portfolio to Cloudflare Pages step-by-step.

## Prerequisites

- A Cloudflare account (sign up at https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up if you don't have one)
- Your portfolio code pushed to a GitHub repository
- Email credentials (Gmail app password) for the contact form

---

## Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

If you haven't already:

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Step 2: Create a Cloudflare Pages Project

1. **Log in to Cloudflare**
   - Go to https://dash.cloudflare.com/
   - Sign in with your account

2. **Navigate to Pages**
   - Click on "Workers & Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Click the "Create application" button
   - Select "Pages" tab
   - Click "Connect to Git"

3. **Connect Your GitHub Repository**
   - Click "Connect GitHub"
   - Authorize Cloudflare to access your GitHub account
   - Select your portfolio repository from the list
   - Click "Begin setup"

---

## Step 3: Configure Build Settings

On the "Set up builds and deployments" page:

1. **Project name**: Choose a name (e.g., `abdirahim-portfolio`)
   - This will be your subdomain: `your-project-name.pages.dev`

2. **Production branch**: `main`

3. **Build settings**:
   - **Framework preset**: Select "Vite" (Do NOT select Next.js)
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Build output directory**: `dist`

   > [!WARNING]
   > Do NOT use the command `npx @cloudflare/next-on-pages`. That is only for Next.js apps.
   > Your project is a Vite + React app. Ensure the Build command is exactly `npm run build`.

4. Click "Save and Deploy"

---

## Step 4: Add Node.js Compatibility Flag

Your application uses Node.js built-in modules (like `crypto`), which require a compatibility flag:

1. **Go to your project settings**
   - Click on your project name in Cloudflare Pages
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Functions" section

2. **Add compatibility flag**
   - Find "Compatibility flags" 
   - Click "Add flag"
   - Enter: `nodejs_compat`
   - Click "Save"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Without this flag, your build will fail with the error: "Could not resolve 'crypto'"

---

## Step 5: Add Resend API Key

We switched to Resend for reliable email delivery on Cloudflare.

1. **Get your API Key**
   - Sign up for free at [resend.com](https://resend.com)
   - Go to "API Keys" -> "Create API Key"
   - Name it "Portfolio" and copy the key (starts with `re_`)

2. **Add it to Cloudflare**
   - Go to your Cloudflare Pages project settings
   - Go to "Settings" -> "Environment variables"
   - Add a new variable:
     - **Variable name**: `RESEND_API_KEY`
     - **Value**: (Paste your Resend API Key)
   - Click "Save"

> [!NOTE]
> You don't need `EMAIL_USER` or `EMAIL_PASS` anymore. You can delete them.
> The `nodejs_compat` flag added in Step 4 is still good practice to keep.

---

## Step 6: Redeploy

After adding environment variables:

1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "..." on the latest deployment
3. Click "Retry deployment"
4. Wait for the build to complete (usually 1-2 minutes)

---

## Step 7: Verify Your Deployment

1. **Visit your site**
   - Your site will be live at: `https://your-project-name.pages.dev`

2. **Test the contact form**
   - Navigate to the Contact section
   - Fill out the form
   - Submit it
   - Check your email inbox for the message

3. **Test all features**
   - Click through all navigation links
   - Open project modals
   - Check that all images load
   - Test on mobile (use browser dev tools)

---

## Step 8: Custom Domain (Optional)

To use your own domain:

1. **In Cloudflare Pages**:
   - Go to your project
   - Click "Custom domains" tab
   - Click "Set up a custom domain"
   - Enter your domain name
   - Follow the DNS configuration instructions

2. **Update DNS**:
   - Add the CNAME record as instructed by Cloudflare
   - Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 24 hours)

---

## Automatic Deployments

Cloudflare Pages will automatically deploy your site whenever you push to your GitHub repository:

- Push to `main` branch → Production deployment
- Push to other branches → Preview deployment

To deploy updates:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update portfolio"
git push
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails

**Check the build logs**:
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click on the failed deployment
3. Review the error messages

**Common issues**:
- Missing dependencies: Make sure `package.json` includes all dependencies
- Build command error: Verify `npm run build` works locally
- Node version: Cloudflare uses Node 18 by default

### Contact Form Not Working

**Check environment variables**:
1. Verify `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` are set correctly
2. Make sure you're using a Gmail app password, not your regular password
3. Redeploy after adding/updating variables

**Check function logs**:
1. Go to "Functions" tab in your project
2. Click on "Real-time logs"
3. Submit the contact form
4. Look for error messages

### Images Not Loading

**Check image paths**:
- All images should be in the `public/images/` folder
- Paths in code should start with `/images/` (not `./images/`)
